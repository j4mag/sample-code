B92_Simulation.ipynb is a jupyter notebook script I wrote for a group project on the B92 quantum algorithm, one designed to securely encode data to alert the recipient about the presence of an evesdropper. All code for this project was written and tested by myself; my partner focused on a mathematical proof.

ESE419FinalProject.ipynb is a jupyter notebook script written for a class on machine learning design. It uses data from the winequality-red.csv open source data set on wine sommelier evaluations.
