This project was a personal project comparing strategies in a game,
using an object-oriented discrete-time simulation approach, in matlab.
This program is run by calling ComparePlayers(p), where p is an array of relative proportions of players.

My matlab license recently expired, so I have not included a sample output of the program. Selfish strategies dominate due to completing more parties on average than other strategies.
